</a>

<p>First of all, Big Bird is <strong>not</strong> a fully fledged framework like Backbone or Ember. It's designed for use when you don't need a MVC framework, but need something simpler and are fed up of writing monolithic jQuery based applications.</p>

<h2 class="h-related">Core principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Provide elegant sturcture to your JavaScript applications.</li>
  <li>Each module should have one responsibility (SRP)</li>
  <li>Modular JavaScript is easier to test in isolation</li>
  <li>Modules should communicate via events using the pub / sub API</li>
  <li>Don't do too much. If you need more, use a more fully featured framework</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h-related">Initialiser</h2>

<p>The intialiser allows you to structure your application into distinct sections that are tied to pages through the DOM. It's built ontop of <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/markup-based-unobtrusive-comprehensive-dom-ready-execution/">DOM Ready Execution</a> by Paul Irish.</p>

<p>This fits in really well with an MVC framework like Rails as your sections relate to controllers, and the actions to functions defined on the body of the application.</p>

<h2 class="h-related">Module</h2>

<p>The Big Bird module is a way of encapsulating class-like logic into one Javascript file. This means that a Module could represent anything from a like button, to a carousel.</p>

<p>A module has methods defined already that help you to perform some of the most common parts of JavaScript functionality like events, proxying functions and manipulating elements on the DOM.</p>
